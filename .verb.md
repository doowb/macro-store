## Usage

Create a [parser](#parser) function that works like [yargs-parser][] or [minimist][] and handles [creating](#create-a-macro), [using](#use-a-macro), and [removing](#delete-a-macro) macros through command line arguments.

```js
var macros = require('{%= name %}');
var parser = macros('macro-store');
var args = parser(process.argv.slice(2));
//=> { _: ['foo', 'bar', 'baz'], verbose: true, cwd: 'qux' }
```

The returned `args` object also contains the [store methods](#store-1) to give implementors direct access to [setting](#set), [getting](#get), and [deleting](#del) macros in the store.

```js
args.set('foo', ['bar', 'baz', 'bang']);
args.get('foo');
//=> ['bar', 'baz', 'bang']
```

## CLI examples

The following examples are using the [example file](example.js) run at the command line with `node example.js`.
The objects returned may be used in implementing applications however they choose.

Jump to [the API documentation](#api) for implementation information.

### Create a macro

The following shows creating a simple macro called `foo`.

### Use a macro

The following shows using the `foo` macro, and that the resulting `args` object contains the expanded value.

### Create a complex macro

The following shows creating a complex macro called `qux` that includes options `--verbose` and `--cwd boop`.

### Using a complex macro

The following shows that using a complex macro is the same as a simple macro, but the `args` object contains the options `verbose: true` and `cwd: 'boop'`, which were set when creating the `qux` macro.

### Delete a macro

The following shows how to delete the macro `foo`. This only deletes `foo` and shows that `qux` is still set.

### Deleting all macros

The following shows how to delete all macros. This shows that `foo` and `qux` have been deleted so the `args` object will contain the exact values passed in from the command line.
